View – The .aspx page (UI), only handles display and user input.

Presenter – Handles business logic, communicates between View and Model.

✅ Advantages over Traditional Web Forms

Better separation of concerns.

Easier unit testing (Presenter can be tested independently).

No direct dependency on Web Forms controls in business logic.
